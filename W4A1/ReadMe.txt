The program illustrates the fundamental difference between allocating memory on the stack and allocating memory on the heap. The difference between allocating on the heap and allocating on the stack any one time is marginal. However, for systems requiring continuous operation, the time cost of allocating on the heap accumulates. In order to illustrate this difference, the program allocates memory more than 100,000 times on both the heap and stack. This reveals a difference greater than .0005, in terms of time, over the course of 100,000 iterations.
