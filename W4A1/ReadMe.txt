The program illustrates the fundamental difference between allocating memory on the stack and allocating memory on the heap. The program allocates memory more than 100,000 times in order to show the difference. This is because the difference is marginal but is important for high volume programs. Furthermore, the extra time required to allocate memory to the heap mirrors the importance and attention required when utilizing the heap.
